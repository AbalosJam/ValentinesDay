			<h1>Dear Douglas,</h1>
			<p>I know you said that you don't really keep track or do much for these kinds of events, but I love your smile and I like making you feel special.</p>
			<p>I may not be the easiest to be with, and it may seem like I'm always upset, and I know I'm far from perfect, but I really do enjoy the time I spend with you. We may not be the most decisive pair when it comes to what to play or what to watch, but know that when I say "I don't really care" it's because I really don't care as long as I'm spending time with you.</p>
			<p>You should know by now that I'm not the best at trying to convey my thoughts across and sometimes I can't English good, but in everything I say never want to make you feel upset or feel unwanted. I'm sorry for making you feel like you're just an inconvenience and that I don't care about you. I never intended to make you feel that way, I just didn't see it in your perspective. Thanks for letting me know how you felt, communication is key for every relationship after all.</p>
			<p>Thank you for giving me your love, time, and patience even though I'm a nub at pretty much everything sexual. I still believe that you deserve someone better than me, but as long as you feel that I am good enough for you, I will try my best to keep you happy. I still need to lvl up though so you may have to carry me.</p>
			<p>Honey, I think you're cute, funny, and obviously sexy, obvi. I'm still falling in love with you with every day we spend together, every night we fall asleep, and every little kisses you give me. Happy Valentines day my love!</p>
			<p>I love you Douglas. I can't wait to fall in love with you more when I see you face to face you crazy goober.</p>
